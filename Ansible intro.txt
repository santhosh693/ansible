Introduction to Ansible :
- Ansible is a simmple IT automation tool makes your applications and systems easier to deploy.
- It supports in configuration management.
- It uses playbooks(yaml) to create Infrastructure as code for deploy applications in various environments (dev,test,prod)

What ANSIBLE does:
- Provisioning
- Change Management
- Automation
- Orchestration
- Configuration of servers
- Application deployment

Why Ansible:
- It is a free open source application
- Agent-less
- No database
- Highly flexible
- It very simple and human readable
- custom modules
- configuration rollback in case of error
- self documenting

What are all core components of ansible
- Ad-hoc commands
- Playbooks
- Module
- Facts
- Inventories
- Variables
- Configuration file
- Templates
- handlers
- Roles
- Vault

1. Ansible Ad-hoc commands
- An Ad-hoc command is something that you might type in to do something really quick.but don't want to save for later.
EX:
$ ansible all -i myhost -b -m apt -a "name=tree"

2. Ansible Playbooks
- playbook are your instruction manual.
- Aplaybook is made up with individual plays
- Aplay is a task
- play book is YAML format

EX:
---
 - hosts:all
   become:yes
   tasks:
   - name: install tree
     apt:
     name:tree
     state:present

3. Ansible Modules
- Ansible with a number of modules
- Modules are discrete units of code that can be used from the command line or in a playbook task.
- Ansible executes each module, usually on the remote target node and collects return values.
- Each module supports taking arguments.nearly all modules take Key=Value arguments,space delimited.
- some modules take no arguments, and the command/shell modules simply take the string of the command you want to run.
EX:
yum
Apt
service
Get_url
...etc

4.Ansible Facts
- Ansible facts is a way of getting the information of hosts(nodes)
- This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful variables about remote hosts that can be used in  playbooks.
- It can also be executed directly by /usr/bin/ansible to check what variables are available to a hosts.
- Ansible provides many facts about the system, automatically.
- This module is also supported for windows targets.
- It's not always required

EX: I want to install webserver on both ubuntu & redaht by same playbook
$ ansible all -i myhosts -m setup -a "filter=*family*"

5. Ansible Inventories
- Ansible works against multiple nodes or "hosts" for your infrastructure at the same time.
- By using a list or group of lists known as inventory.
- Once your inventory is defined, you can use to select the hosts or groups you can run ansible commands.
- Ansible uses a combination of a hosts file and a group_vars directory to pull variables per host group and run ansible plays against hosts.
- The defalt location for Inventorie file is /etc/ansible/hosts
- we can be called from a different hostfile by using "-i"
- you can also use multiple inventory files at the same time.
= Inventories are two types:
  . static
  . Dynamic


Static Inventories EX:
[webserver]
node1 IP
node2 IP

[dbservers]
node3 Ip

[all]
node1 IP 
node2 IP
node3 IP
